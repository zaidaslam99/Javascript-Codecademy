/*
    * While writting code it can be useful to keep track of datatypes 
    of the variables in your program. If you want to check the datatypes 
    you can use the typeof operator.

    * The typeof checks its value to the right and returns or passes back 
    a string of the data type.  

    * So here lets examine what is going on here notice that we are declaring the variable 
    and then we are using the typeof variable the first variable we set to string the 
    second variable we set to string and last one is a bool value. We then just use console.log()
    and within it we use the typeof() essentially what we are saying is that hey print the type variable 
    to get the variable status its important to understand layout notice that we didnt separate the typeof()
    with comas or any (). Instead what we did was we typed it right next to it that is interesting compared to 
    the pythonic way of doing things.
