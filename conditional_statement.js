    * So now we are going to be talking about conditional statements and the thing to 
    know here is format when it comes to these conditional statement notice that  within 
    the () we have a boolean value that is true and then wihtin the {} we have a message 
    that display.

    * So when we write code in python when it comes to if statements its ususally if conditon:
    the catch that is different is that where we see true we are writting our conditon here that is 
    something that I wanted to bring to attention.

    * Another detail momment that I learned from this code is that notice how we are using console.log();
    this has an ending ; when it comes to the conditional statment there is not ending ; that is something 
    to be aware of here as well.

// More practice...

let sale = 15000;

if (true) {
      console.log(`The store had made $${sale}`);

/*
    * So notice what we did here we declared a variable and then we 
    used that variable value using the backticks and the ${} this made the 
    code more readable and demonstrated our understanding of how to use this 
    approach.
*/

// Declared a variable and then assigned its boolean value.
let x = true;

// Changed the value of the boolean to false
x = false;

if (x) {
    console.log("This will not print");   
}


/*
    * So here I wanted to demonstrate our understanding of this code 
    notice in the if statement within the () we set our varibale value and 
    then we used the console.log() and then the print statement in it.

    * Something else that I wanted to mention here is that we set our boolean value 
    to false after stating it to true and notice how we did it we had declared it 
    first and then changed it just by over ridding it.
