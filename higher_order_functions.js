/* 
    * General notes: So in programming we can accomplish abstraction by writting functions 
    in addition to allow us to reuse our code functions help to make clear readable programs 
    if you entered countToThree() in a program you will be able to guess what the function did 
    without having to stop and read the function body. Now we are going to be talking about 
    higher order functions which are functions that accept other functions as arguemnts and or 
    return functions as output this enables us to build abstraction on other abstraction just like 
    we hosted a birthday party which is an abstraction on we built a cake abstraction helps us write 
    more modular code which is easier to read and debug.
