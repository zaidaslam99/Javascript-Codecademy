    * So notice that I declared this variable to be a false value and then I 
    am saying let the undefined_var if its true then let it equal to the defined_tue_var
    or else false then let be be equal to the oppsite side and when it checks to see 
    the variable side wheter its true or false it will then execute that its important 
    to understand that logic.
