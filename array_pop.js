/*
    * Here lets take a look at what is going on the first thing that I wanted 
    to make clear is that when we use the pop method this is going to removing 
    the last element from the list the mistake that I made was that I was thinking 
    that when it comes to the list it was going to print out all the elements 
    and no its important to undertand the way we wrote it list then we remove the 
    last element and then we print list after removing the last element and the element 
    that we removed that is all there is to understand.
