/* Here lets examine what is going on the first thing that we need to 
know is that we created a variable using the const value and then in it 
we used the require keyword what this did that it loads a module it kind 
of works similar to an import statement where we import the file and then 
we can work with the module the next thing that we did was that we created 
a function and then used the Airplane object file that contains all the 
methods and used them to access a particualr property using the file.property 
now this can be a method to even a attribute key that is something to be aware 
of here */
