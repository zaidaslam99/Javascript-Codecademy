// Declare a variable.
let myPet = "Armadalio";

// Display value of variable plus string.
console.log("The variable is storing the animal", myPet, ".")

/*
    * So this is some simple string concat ngl the thing that I learned in this 
    code when it comes to visual studio code is that it follows the similar space rule 
    to python overall the code is really simple to understand.

// More practice.

var favAnimal = "Hawk";

console.log("My fav animal is", favAnimal);
