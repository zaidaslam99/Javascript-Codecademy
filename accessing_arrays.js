/*
    * So here it simple what is going on we are learning 0 indexing again and when it 
    comes to strings we look at the first character and when it comes to list we are looking 
    at the first element. You can also store the first item into a variable and then print 
    that variable that is what the video did. So something that I wanted to mention here is 
    that if you try to log something that is not within the list index then its going to give 
    an undefined error.
