/*
    * So this is a new concept and this is called string interpolation
        we can insert or interpolate variables into strings using templates.
        So notice what is happening in this code we declared a variable called 
        myPet notice that it is a name constant the next thing that we are doing 
        is using console log and here is the catch refer to next bullet point.
    
    *   A template is wrapped by backticks ` its these now this is something that I 
        really never used when it comes to the keyboard. This key is close to the number 
        1.
    
    *   So notice that in the bracket we gave the ${} here this is alot similar to using 
        a format specifer when it comes to Python. Within our {} its important to understand 
        that the dollar sign shows up other wise this code is not going to work. The advantage 
        to doing this code is that this makes the code more easier to read. Another advantage 
        of using this way is that we then dont have to worry about double quotes and comas dilema.

// Practice...

const myName = "Zaid";
console.log(`${myName} is learning JavaScript programming language`);

/*
    * Something that I wanted to mention in this line of code is that be sure to use 
    back ticks and the other thing is that I finally learned why camelcase is efficent 
    and first letter is lowercase it speed up writting variables and keeps them different.
