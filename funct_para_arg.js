/* 
    * So here we created a function called sayThanks and what we did was that we passed in 
    an argument to the function and in this case its my name and that is going to the name 
    variable overall the concept is similar to python but insted of say def we use function 
    and when it comes to var we use the let, var

        var x;
        x = 10 
        console.log(x);
