    * Something that I wanted to make mention of here is that something that

    keyword and thought that we are making a function into a variable and we are 
    it sounds right but I thought of it as a new concept instead in python it would 
    mean that x = [] or x = {} yet in JS we are doing is that let x = [] all we are 
    doing is using the let keyword to declare a variable and I was thinking that we 
    are creating a function within a variable.
