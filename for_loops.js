    * So first thing that we need to know here is that when it comes 
    to this code we have a list that has 5 elements its going to print the 
    index of these list not the list itself the second thing that I wanted 
    to make mention was that the loop starts from 0 index and the second 
    condition is as long as index is less the array length and then increment the 
    index

    saying if i <= 10 meaning that max number is going to be 10 and then increment and 
    than print i something that I wanted to make mention of this was these code when I 
    used to look at them it looked complicated and now they start looking more easier to
    decipher and something that I wanted to make clear was that when we work with the
    logic when it comes to list such as indexing we state where its going to start and then 
    the last number is not including when it comes to loops it often works as how it is really
    so what you read is what the output is going to be.
