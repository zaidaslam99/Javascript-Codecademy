function monitorCount(rows, coloums ) {
    return rows * coloums
}

const numOfMonitor = monitorCount(5, 4)

console.log(numOfMonitor);

/*
    * So this code was different because this was something that I had not really 
    used for example monitorCount and here we put the rows and coloums and all we 
    did was return the rows and coloums and multipled it something that was new to 
    me was that notice in the variable we are called the function and then passing 
    in two arguemnt this was new because this was something that I was thinking that 
    we can do this so it was a learning momment that we can pass in a function to a 
    variable that is then going to do some arithmetics and store that value to a const 
    variable and then we logged the variable that is something to understand when it 
    comes to writting this code.
