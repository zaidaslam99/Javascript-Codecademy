/*
    * So here lets examine what is going on we are comparing the 
    string apples to oranges we state if the strings are equal then we want
    to ouput true and then we are saying if apples is not equal to oranges 
    then we display true so logic wise it makes sense. The thing that I wanted 
    to point was javascript writes == as === and != as !== this is something 
    to be aware about here.
