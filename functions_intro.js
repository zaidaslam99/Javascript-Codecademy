    * Here this is a simple thing to understand but the thing that I wanted to mention was that 
    when it comes to python we use the def keyword and then proceed to define a function and when 
    it comes to JS what we do is that we have to identify that we are using a function and then write 
    the name of the function and then within the constructors we can pass in parameters and then we 
    can log what we want.

// So here we are demonstrating the knowledge of calling the function three times.
